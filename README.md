# Waggle-BI-Report_Lapdog-vs-Lapcat
Power BI report that tells the story of how the Lapcat data compares to findings from the dog collar Lapdog devices

## Introduction
This project is the second of three projects in the Udacity Data Analysis and Visualization with Microsoft Power BI Nanodegree Program. ***Waggle***, a startup that makes smart devices for pets has been thrilled by the success of their new _Lapdog_ device, a fitness collar that lets owners track their dog’s steps, alerts them when it’s time for a walk, and even repels fleas! Reviews have been fantastic, sales are growing, and—best of all—the product really works!

Waggle is pushing for a feline (cats) version but are concerned about its viability. The team distrbuted 1,000 Lapcat prototypes for field testing.

## Business Requests
The major research questions are:
1. Did the average daily steps increase for cats wearing the device as they did for dogs?
2. Were owners of Lapcat devices as satisfied with the product as Lapdog owners?

## Data Modelling
The data was provided and has been prepared for analysis by Udacity

The average daily steps for dogs using Lapdog has increased steadily since 2018 which has led to a high average ratings of 4.69 out of 5 while the average daily steps for cats has seen a relative decrease since the study started which has led to a low satisfaction, it had an average rating of 1.64 out of 5.
